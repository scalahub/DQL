%\paragraph{\dsl~Compiler:} 
%\paragraph{Configuration Validation.}\label{para:rulevalidation}
%The configuration is validated to eliminate any errors in the basis or the initial rule definitions. Appendix~\ref{validation} describes the various checks.
%\paragraph{Compilation and Optimization.}\label{compiler}
%The compiler converts \dsl~code into Datalog rules that can be fed to a Datalog engine. 
%The compiler is written entirely in Scala 
%~\cite{Odersky:2011:PSC:1983576} 
%Initially \dsl~code is parsed into an AST 
%using ANTLR~\cite{antlr}. %, which is then used to generate the Datalog code. 
%Section~\ref{compilerlogic} describes the compilation logic of \dsl. %In addition, %\dsl~additionally provides the following optimizations: 
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item 
%{\em Rule filtering} %Rule filtering 
	%is used to avoid evaluating unnecessary rules. From the initial Datalog rules, only the rules reachable from the queries are evaluated.  
%	\item 
%{\em 
%Magic Sets:} 
%Magic sets}~\cite{Bancilhon:1985:MSO:6012.15399} are used to avoid generating unnecessary facts. %The latter optimization is provided by the IRIS engine itself. 
%\end{itemize}
